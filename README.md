# LwDITA to DITA2.0 POC
Proof-of-concept for sharing LwDITA and DITA 2.0 spec content

Here we (members of the Lightweight DITA Subcommittee of the OASIS DITA Technical Committee) provide proof-of-concept Lightweight DITA specification topics to demonstrate content reuse between Lightweight DITA and DITA 2.0.

This repository includes draft spec topics for LwDITA components: data, cross reference, short description. `@props` is used as a filtering attribute, with values "dita2.0" and "lwdita".
